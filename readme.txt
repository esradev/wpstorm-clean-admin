You can choose to either deactivate users (assign them an "inactive" role) or permanently delete them. This is configurable in the plugin settings.

= Can I exclude certain user roles? =

Yes, you can exclude specific user roles from inactivity checks. Administrator role is always excluded by default for safety.

= How is inactivity determined? =

Inactivity is based on the last login time. If a user hasn't logged in within your specified number of days, they're considered inactive.

= Does this work with multisite? =

The current version is designed for single-site installations. Multisite compatibility is planned for future releases.

= Is it safe to automatically delete users? =

The plugin includes safeguards like role exclusions and administrator protection. However, we recommend reviewing inactive users before enabling automatic deletion.
